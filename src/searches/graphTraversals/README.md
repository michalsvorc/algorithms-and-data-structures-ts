# Graph traversals

## Breadth-first search (BFS)

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key')
and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.

## Depth-first search (DFS)

Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores
as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
