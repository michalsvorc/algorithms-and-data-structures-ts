# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key')
and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.
