# Merge sort

In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output.

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
- Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
- Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
